  "description": "The Game of Shells involves a flat surface, a row of three small containers and a ball small enough to fit underneath each of them. On each turn of the game the player is shown the ball being placed under one of the containers before the order of the containers is repeatedly shuffled at random. The player has to guess correctly which container the ball is under in order to win; otherwise they lose.",
